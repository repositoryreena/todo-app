To-Do List App
Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple, functional To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.

How It Works
Adding Tasks: Users can type a task into the input field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
Marking Tasks as Complete: Each task has a "✔" button that, when clicked, toggles the task's completion status. A completed task will be visually crossed out.
Deleting Tasks: Each task has a "❌" button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
Persistent Storage: The tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage so that they are saved even when the user refreshes the page. This includes the task text and whether it is marked as complete.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository (if using Git): git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>

Open the project:

Navigate to the project directory where the files are located.
Run the app:

Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
The app should now be functional, and you can start adding tasks to your To-Do List!
Optional (for developers):

If you want to make modifications or test changes locally, you can edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files using any code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
Files
index.html: The HTML structure of the app.
styles.css: The CSS file that provides the app's styling.
script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the app's functionality (adding, completing, deleting tasks, and saving to localStorage).
tests.js: A placeholder file (could be used for testing purposes).
